## Inspiration

North East has a vast potential for tourism but there are very less of them to be seen.So, this is for their convenience that we made this app. Currently, it supports realtime Weather Forecasting and some SmallTalks. Hotel Booking System is yet to be integrated with Third Party APIs.

## Installing

1. Open console at [DialogFlow](https://www.dialogflow.com) and make a new Agent.
2. Goto Settings > Export and Import > Import from zip and open zip file.
3. Now, for configuring [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), make a new Github Repository with files inside flask folder as contents.
4. Goto [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and deploy that flask repo.
5. Go back to DialogFlow. Open Integrations and deploy on your favourite media platform
